# Data Management Plan Assignment

### Due: 6 November 2019

## Write a Data Management Plan

For this assignment, you must write a data management plan (DMP) for *your* research. 

This assignment will consist of two parts. Both must meet the **format requirements** outlined in the section below.

1. A title and brief description of your research project. [**1 page maximum**]
2. Data management plan for your research project. Find the general guidelines for NSF data management plans. You can find this in the [excerpt from the NSF proposal preparation guide](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546X-Fall2019/blob/master/assignments/DMP_Assignment/NSF-DMP.md) we have provided in the course repository. [**2 pages maximum**]

The research project you write about for this assignment does not *have* to be your entire PhD thesis. It can just be just a sub-project within your larger research program. If your research is still not well defined, then choose something related or projects within the same lab. 

Be sure to follow the format requirements outlined below.

### Suggestions and Guides

There really isn't a one-size-fits-all data management plan for biology research. The organization and content of your DMP will depend on the types of data you collect and the ways in which you analyze those data. Furthermore, if your work involves writing code, you may also need to consider how you will make your scripts and software available. 

The Iowa State University libraries provide some helpful and general [guidelines for writing a DMP](hhttp://instr.iastate.libguides.com/dmp/home).
Feel free to use these guidelines for writing your DMP. Alternatively, you can use any of the sources available online, like the [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/). Note that tools like these do not _necessarily_ keep up-to-date with agency format requirements, so it is important to always double check that your document's format is correct.

### Format Requirements

We are asking that you follow the [NSF proposal preparation guidelines](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/pappg_2.jsp) for this assignment. Thus, the DMP must conform to the following requirements:

* Use one of the following typefaces identified below:
	* Arial, Helvetica, Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;
	* Times New Roman at a font size of 11 points or larger; or
	* Computer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.
* A font size of less than 10 points may be used for mathematical formulas or equations, figures, table or diagram captions and when using a Symbol font to insert Greek letters or special characters. PIs are cautioned, however, that the text must still be readable.
* No more than six lines of text within a vertical space of one inch.
* Margins, in all directions, must be at least an inch.
